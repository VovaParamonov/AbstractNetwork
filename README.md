It is my laboratory work on computer graphics

The program is implemented in C++ (openGL) using the glut library. 

When running, the program places a given number of points at random coordinates 
and sets each random velocity value from a given range. If the distance between 
the points is less than the specified distance, a line is formed between them, 
the thickness of which depends on the distance
